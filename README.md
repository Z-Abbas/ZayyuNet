# ZayyuNet
A unified deep learning model for the identification of epigenetic modifications using raw genomic sequences

ZayyuNet is a new framework for the prediction of post-transcriptional modifications (6mA/m6A, 4mC, and psi) using raw genomic sequences. The architecture is different from the traditional deep learning models created and inspired by the SpinalNet architecture.

The overview of ZayyuNet architecture is illustrated in the figure below:
